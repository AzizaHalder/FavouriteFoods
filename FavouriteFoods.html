      <h2>Pommes</h2>
      <p>I have many favourite things, but pommes / hot chips / frites, however
      you want to call them, are probably one of my most beloved foods. Specifically
      hot, crispy curly fries with salt and freshly squeezed lemon juice.. absolute
      <em>heaven</em> for me.</p>

      <h2>Fruits</h2>
      <p>When I lived in Australia, my diet consisted primarily of fruits.
      It was so readily available, mostly Australian grown and no matter the
      season, always a good variety!</p>

      <p>I'm definitely someone that goes throug phases in fruits, so here a few
        of my most loved fruits in no particular order</p>

        <ul>Mangoes</ul>
        <ul>Watermelon</ul>
        <ul>Manderines</ul>
        <ul>Peaches</ul>
        <ul>Pineapple</ul>
      </li>

      <h2>Pasta al pomodoro</h2>
      <p>I have to admit, I had to look up the correct name for 'Spaghetti with
      Tomato Sauce', not to be confused with 'Pasta with Ketchup'. Something
      eaten on occassion by my Grandmother... Something I will never understand
      A fresh tomato suace is so simple and delicious. I make probably once a
      fortnight, if not once a week. Keep it simple with </p>
