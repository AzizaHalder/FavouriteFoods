      <h1>Food</h1>
      <p>I <em>loooooove</em> food. I <strong>love</strong> to eat food. My favourite
        foods? Hard to say, I often go through phases. At the moment it's Blueberries.
        Every morning I mix oats, flax seeds and chia seeds; add hot water; soak briefly;
        add blueberries, banana, yoghurt, almonds; mix and voila, breakfast is served.
        Blueberries by the handful are also pretty delicious.</p>

        <p>I definitely have favourites that I keep going back too.</p>
